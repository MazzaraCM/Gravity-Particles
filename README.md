*Gravity Particles Simulation*

This project is a simple HTML5 + JS canvas-based simulation of particles influenced by gravity and capable of interacting with each other through collisions. Users can control various parameters such as gravity, friction, collision margins, and more using an interactive control panel. The simulation offers a visual representation of particle dynamics within a canvas environment, providing an engaging experience for users interested in physics simulations.

**Features:**

- Particle system influenced by gravity and friction.
- Realistic collision interactions between particles.
- Basic User-configurable parameters through an interactive control panel.
- Visual representation of particle behavior in a dynamic canvas environment.

**How to Use:**

- npm install
- npm run dev
- Use the control panel to adjust gravity, friction, and other simulation parameters.
- Click or Click-move to interact with particles.
- Observe the dynamic behavior of particles influenced by the configured settings.
- This project serves as an educational tool for understanding basic physics principles and JavaScript animation within a web development context.
